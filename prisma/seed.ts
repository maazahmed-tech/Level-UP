  const aboutBio = `Raheel is a qualified Athletic Therapist (B.Sc Hons) and certified personal trainer with over a decade of experience in the health and fitness industry. His journey began on the pitch — working with athletes recovering from injury — before transitioning into body composition coaching, where he discovered his true passion: helping everyday people transform their physiques and their confidence.

Specialising in fat loss and body recomposition, Raheel takes a science-first approach to every client he works with. There are no fad diets, no detox teas, and no magic supplements in his programmes. Instead, he builds sustainable nutrition and training systems rooted in evidence-based principles — calorie balance, progressive overload, and behavioural psychology. The result is a method that does not just deliver short-term results but teaches clients how to maintain them for life.

Having helped hundreds of people across Ireland and internationally achieve their goals — from busy parents who thought they had no time, to office workers who had never set foot in a gym — Raheel understands that transformation is about far more than sets and reps. It is about understanding your habits, working with your lifestyle, and building the knowledge that empowers you to take control of your health on your own terms.`;
